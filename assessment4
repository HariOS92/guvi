#Will a longer run time bring higher profits?
dataBudgetRevenue.plot(x='runtime',y='profit',kind='scatter')
# inference - movies with runtime between 50 to 150 days made higher profits

#Does the presence of a homepage indicate higher profits
plt.bar(dataBudgetRevenue['homePagePresent'] ,dataBudgetRevenue['profit'])
# inference - Profit does not depend on Home page

#Over a period of time, how have the profitability changed - Over the period of time, which genre of movies have grossed well ?

# inference - 

#If the movie speaks multiple languages, is the profit % higher?
plt.bar(dataBudgetRevenue['TotalLanguages'], dataBudgetRevenue['profit'])
# inference - If movies released upto 3 languages has more profit, more than 3 languages does not guarantee more profit
